Rust programs have 3 mem regions where data is stored:

1) Data Memory: 
    for data that is fixed in size and STATIC; ex: "Hello, World!" - string
    STATIC meaning always available through life of program
    very fast - since locations are known and fixed

2) Stack Memory: 
    for data that is declared as variables within a func
    location of this mem never changes for the duration of func call
    very fast to access

3) Heap Memory:
    for data that is created while application is running
    data may be added, removed, moved, resized, etc
    dynamic nature -> generally slower -> allows creative usage of mem
    adding data to this region = allocation
    removing data from this region = deallocation
